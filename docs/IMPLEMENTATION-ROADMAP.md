# Implementation Roadmap

Update this file's checkboxes at the end of every phase. Each phase should end with the
artifact checklist in the master prompt (section 27) completed before moving on.

- [x] Phase 0 — Environment + architecture. See "Phase 0 report" below.
- [x] Phase 1 — Repository/monorepo foundation (pnpm workspace, root tsconfig/eslint/prettier, CI skeleton). See "Phase 1 report" below.
- [ ] Phase 2 — Next.js frontend shell
- [ ] Phase 3 — NestJS backend shell (+ `/health`, `/ready`)
- [ ] Phase 4 — PostgreSQL + Prisma (first migration: `users` groundwork only as auth needs it)
- [ ] Phase 5 — Authentication (Clerk vs Auth.js decision + implementation)
- [ ] Phase 6 — Multi-tenancy (`organizations`, `organization_members`, tenant-isolation tests)
- [ ] Phase 7 — Instagram account domain model (`instagram_accounts` table, no Zernio calls yet)
- [ ] Phase 8 — Zernio provider abstraction (`InstagramProvider` interface + `ZernioInstagramProvider` skeleton)
- [ ] Phase 9 — Zernio account connection (real OAuth flow)
- [ ] Phase 10 — Webhook ingestion (`POST /webhooks/zernio`, `webhook_events`, idempotency)
- [ ] Phase 11 — Redis + BullMQ (queue wiring, `apps/worker` boots, local Postgres/Redis strategy finalized)
- [ ] Phase 12 — Automation engine (`packages/automation-engine`, generic trigger/condition/action model)
- [ ] Phase 13 — Comment keyword automation (first real trigger wired end to end)
- [ ] Phase 14 — Public comment reply + DM actions
- [ ] Phase 15 — Contact management (`contacts`, `contact_events`, audit logs)
- [ ] Phase 16 — Analytics (`analytics_daily`)
- [ ] Phase 17 — Workflow builder UI (React Flow)
- [ ] Phase 18 — Inbox/conversations (`conversations`, `messages`)
- [ ] Phase 19 — Follow-up workflows (delays, branching)
- [ ] Phase 20 — Billing and usage (`subscriptions`, `plans`, `usage_records`)
- [ ] Phase 21 — Security hardening
- [ ] Phase 22 — Production deployment

## Phase 0 report

**Environment**
- Existing Node: `v16.13.0` (global, untouched)
- Required project Node: `24.x` (Active LTS)
- Project-local Node strategy: official Windows zip distribution extracted to `.tools/node/`
  (gitignored); all scripts prepend it to PATH for that process only. No global installs.
- npm: `8.1.0` (global) — project uses pnpm via the project-local Node's corepack instead.
- Git: `2.49.0.windows.1` — present, usable.
- Docker: **not installed**. Docker Compose: **not available**.
- Corepack: `0.10.0`, bundled with the global Node — project uses the copy bundled with the
  project-local Node 24 instead.
- No admin rights on this machine; project directory is writable without elevation.

**Architecture**
- Final stack, repo structure, modules, and flows: see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Database strategy: PostgreSQL + Prisma, tables introduced per-phase, see `docs/DATABASE.md`.
- Queue strategy: Redis + BullMQ, queues named per master spec section 16, see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Zernio integration strategy: `InstagramProvider`/`ZernioInstagramProvider` abstraction,
  researched against live docs.zernio.com, see `docs/ZERNIO-INTEGRATION.md`.

**Artifacts created in Phase 0**
- `docs/PRODUCT-REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT-SETUP.md`,
  `docs/DATABASE.md`, `docs/ZERNIO-INTEGRATION.md`, `docs/WEBHOOKS.md`,
  `docs/AUTOMATION-ENGINE.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`,
  `docs/API-SPEC.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md` (this file), `docs/ADR/0001-modular-monolith.md`,
  `docs/ADR/0002-project-local-node-and-no-docker-fallback.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`
- `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `docker-compose.yml`, root `package.json`
- `scripts/setup.ps1`, `scripts/dev.ps1`, `scripts/test.ps1`, `scripts/lint.ps1`
- Directory skeleton: `apps/{web,api,worker}`, `packages/{database,shared,validation,zernio,automation-engine}`,
  `infra/{docker,nginx}`, `tests/e2e`, `docs/{ADR,RUNBOOKS}` (each with a placeholder `README.md`)
- Git repository initialized, initial commit made.

**Known limitations / risks**
- No admin rights + no Docker means local Postgres/Redis needs a decision (portable
  binaries vs cloud dev DB) before Phase 4/11 — not blocking Phase 0-3, but flagged now.
- Auth provider (Clerk vs Auth.js) not yet chosen — needed before Phase 5.
- Zernio's story-reply support for Instagram is ambiguous in its own docs (the
  comment-automations API accepts a `story_reply` trigger value, but the Instagram platform
  page says story replies aren't available via the API) — needs hands-on sandbox
  verification before Phase 13 relies on it either way.
- Zernio rate limits aren't documented in the pages reviewed — needed before Phase 12's
  retry/backoff design is finalized.
- pnpm workspace vs Turborepo, and exact CI scope, are decided in Phase 1, not here.

## Phase 1 report

**What was built**
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`apps/*`, `packages/*`) — pnpm workspaces, not Turborepo (see
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` open decisions; revisit only once build times justify it).
- Root `tsconfig.base.json` (strict, `NodeNext`, `noEmit`) extended by a `tsconfig.json` in
  every workspace member.
- Root `eslint.config.mjs` (flat config): `@eslint/js` recommended + `typescript-eslint`
  recommended + `eslint-config-prettier` (turns off stylistic rules Prettier owns).
- Root `.prettierrc.json` / `.prettierignore` (Markdown excluded for now — see note below)
  and `.editorconfig`.
- Every `apps/*` and `packages/*` member got a minimal `package.json` (scoped
  `@automationdm/*`, `lint`/`typecheck` scripts) + `tsconfig.json` + a placeholder
  `src/index.ts` (`export {};`) — just enough for the workspace tooling to have something
  real to check; no framework, no business code.
- Root `package.json`: removed the npm-style `workspaces` field (redundant with
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`), simplified `engines.node` to `>=20`, added `eslint`/`typecheck`/
  `format`/`format:check` scripts and the eslint/typescript-eslint/prettier/typescript
  devDependencies.
- `scripts/lint.ps1` now runs `eslint`, `typecheck`, and `format:check` (was previously
  wired to a `--recursive lint`/`typecheck` pattern that no per-package script yet backed).
- `scripts/test.ps1` now uses `--if-present` so it no-ops cleanly until a package defines a
  real `test` script (none does yet — no test runner is introduced in Phase 1).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `actions/checkout` → `actions/setup-node@v4` (Node 24) →
  `corepack enable` → `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` → `pnpm run eslint` →
  `pnpm run typecheck` → `pnpm run format:check`. Runs on GitHub's own ubuntu-latest
  runner, not the local dev machine — installing Node/pnpm there does not conflict with the
  "never touch this machine's global Node" rule, which is scoped to the local dev box.
- `.gitignore`: added `.claude/` (AI tool session state, not a project artifact).

**Commands executed and results**
| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --version` / `npm --version` (before) | `v16.13.0` / `8.1.0` (global, untouched) |
| `.\scripts\setup.ps1` | Downloaded Node `v24.19.0` zip to `.tools/node/`, enabled corepack, ran `pnpm install` — 9 workspace projects, 110 packages resolved. Exit 0. |
| `.\scripts\lint.ps1` (1st run) | ESLint: 0 errors. Typecheck: 8/8 packages `Done`. `format:check`: **failed** — 4 files (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) not Prettier-formatted (double vs single quotes). |
| `pnpm run format` | Rewrote those 4 files to match `.prettierrc.json` (`singleQuote: true`). |
| `.\scripts\lint.ps1` (2nd run) | ESLint: 0 errors. Typecheck: 8/8 `Done`. `format:check`: **all files pass**. Exit 0. |
| `.\scripts\test.ps1` | No package defines `test` yet → no-op via `--if-present`. Exit 0. |
| `act` (run CI workflow locally) | **Not available** — not installed, and it also depends on Docker, which isn't installed either (see Phase 0). Substituted by running the workflow's actual commands (`eslint`, `typecheck`, `format:check`) locally, which is what the workflow itself runs. |
| `node --version` / `npm --version` (after) | `v16.13.0` / `8.1.0`, same path (`C:\Program Files\nodejs`) — **unchanged** |
| `git status --ignored` | Confirms `.tools/` and `node_modules/` are ignored, not staged |
| secret scan (`.env*` presence + grep for key/secret/token/password literals in new/changed files) | No `.env` file present (only `.env.example`), no hardcoded secret-like values found |

**Files created**
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `tsconfig.base.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierrc.json`,
`.prettierignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
(generated), and per workspace member (`apps/web`, `apps/api`, `apps/worker`,
`packages/database`, `packages/shared`, `packages/validation`, `packages/zernio`,
`packages/automation-engine`): `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/index.ts`.

**Files modified**
`package.json` (root), `scripts/lint.ps1`, `scripts/test.ps1`, `docker-compose.yml`
(Prettier quote-style only), `.gitignore` (added `.claude/`), this file.

**Known limitations**
- No test runner is wired up yet (Vitest/Jest, per `docs/TESTING.md`) — intentionally out
  of scope for Phase 1; `scripts/test.ps1` and the root `test` script exist but are no-ops
  until a real package needs them.
- Markdown files are excluded from Prettier's `format:check` (`.prettierignore`) to avoid
  reformatting the prose-heavy Phase 0 docs as an unrelated side effect of this phase;
  revisit if/when Markdown formatting in CI becomes a real requirement.
- `act`/Docker aren't available on this machine, so the GitHub Actions workflow itself has
  only been validated by running its component commands locally and by its own YAML
  parsing succeeding under Prettier — not by an actual local Actions run. It will get its
  first real run on the next `git push` to a GitHub remote (not done here — no remote is
  configured, and none should be pushed to without being asked).

**Next phase**

Phase 2 will scaffold the Next.js frontend shell inside `apps/web` (App Router, TypeScript,
Tailwind, shadcn/ui) — replacing the current placeholder `package.json`/`src/index.ts` with
a real (still featureless) Next.js app that builds and typechecks under this same
workspace tooling. Phase 2 will not start until the user says to proceed.
